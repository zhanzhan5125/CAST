You will be given one comment written for a function code.

Your task is to rate the comment on the metrics, finally output the score in JSON:

Evaluation metric:
Conciseness({S_min} - {S_max})
1. Start with an action verb.
2. Focus on the main purpose.
3. Specific implementation details should not be described.
A comment with a score of {S_min} is overly lengthy, while with a score of {S_max} is able to balance the readability with context.

Your Steps:
1. Read the code carefully and identify the main function and check if the comment meets the criteria for Conciseness.
2. Assign a reasonable score for Conciseness on a scale of {S_min} to {S_max}.
3. Output the score in JSON format.

Code:
{Code}

Comment:
{Comment}

Output:
{"Conciseness": ""}
