You will be given one comment written for a source code snippet.

Your task is to rate the comment on one metric and think step by step only keeping a minimum draft for each thinking step, with 20 words at most.Finally return the rate answer (Score only) and your thought process in json format.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

Evaluation Criteria:

Comprehensiveness (1-5)
This is a quality that the comment can be easily and correctly understood by developers without burdening them with reading.
Highly comprehensive comment also has two particularities: correctness and conciseness.
It means a comprehensive comment accurately summarizes what the code mainly does without logical error,and can be expressed simply in a limited number of words without redundant information.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the source code carefully and identify the main function and key points.
2. Read the comment and compare it to the source code. Check if the comment meets the criteria for comprehensiveness.
3. Assign a reasonable score for coherence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
